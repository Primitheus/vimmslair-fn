# Vimm's Lair - FN
## About
Vimm's Lair is a preservation project targeting old console videogames. As of June 6th 2024, many games were removed.
I am a firm believer of preservation and public archive projects and hate to see active attempts to prevent such preservation.

This (Unofficial) Chromium Browser Extension provides a solution for those who still want to retrieve the ROMs.
The N stands for Nintendo, you can guess the rest.

## Installation
``git clone https://github.com/Primitheus/vimmslair-fn.git``

Enable Developer Mode in the Extensions settings.
Use the ``Load unpacked`` button in the Extensions settings and select the ``vimmslair-fn`` folder.

## Usage
Find a ROM that does not download and has the online emulation feature.
Click "Play online" on the webpage.
Open the Extension, and if a game is found it should show the name of the game.
Click "Download" inside the Extension.
